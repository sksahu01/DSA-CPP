136. Single Number
Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.


Sol:
class Solution {
public:
    int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        int a=0;
        for(int v:nums){
            a^=v;
        }
        return a;
    }
};
